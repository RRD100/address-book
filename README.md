# Address Book
Realm Digital Interview Assessment - Address Book
- By Riaan Davids

A web application where a user can manage an address book

## Features

* A user can see a list of their contacts
* A user is able to search their contacts
* A user is able to create a new contact
* A user is able to update an existing contact
* A user is able to delete a contact
* A contact consists of a first name and a last name
* A contact can have unlimited contact numbers and email addresses (Please see Side Note)

## Technologies Used

* Database
* Laravel Framework 6.5.1
* HTML & CSS & JQuery

## Side Note
* Unfortunately, due to time constraints, I could not accomplished this, but I've added an alternative email and an alternative phone input boxes. I used the same db structure concept that I would have used for the unlimited contacts. I just had to add the functionality in the front view to add an extra field for either a contact number or email.
* I've also included the db dump file called address_book_db.sql.zip in the root folder.
